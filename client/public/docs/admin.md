## Overview

The admin dashboard provides a centralised view of all bookings across the cluster, with tools to manage bookings, control Kueue reservation sync, and export or import the database.

## Logging In

Navigate to `/admin/login` and enter the admin password. On success, a session cookie is set and you are redirected to the admin dashboard.

The admin password is configured via the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable (or `server.adminPassword` in the Helm chart).

---

## Header

The header bar shows:

- **Title and clock** -- live datetime in your browser's local timezone
- **Reservations toggle** -- green ON / red OFF button to enable or disable Kueue reservation sync at runtime without redeploying
- **Refresh** -- manually reload booking data
- **Logout** -- end the admin session

## Summary Tiles

Four resource tiles show the total number of active bookings per GPU type (H200 Full GPU, MIG 3g.71gb, MIG 2g.35gb, MIG 1g.18gb) along with the total unit count.

Click a tile to filter the bookings table to that resource type. Click again to clear the filter.

## Filters

### Source Filter

Filter bookings by their source:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **All** | Show all bookings (default) |
| **Reserved** | Show only user-created reservations |
| **Consumed** | Show only Kueue auto-bookings from active workloads |

Each button shows a count of matching bookings.

### Text Filter

The search box in the bookings table header filters by ID, user, resource, date, email, description, or slot type. Filtering is case-insensitive and matches substrings.

---

## Database Export / Import

The Database controls allow you to download a backup of the SQLite database or restore from a previous backup.

### Export

Click **Export** to download the current `bookings.db` file. The server flushes the WAL (Write-Ahead Log) before streaming the file, ensuring a consistent snapshot.

### Import

Click **Import** to upload a replacement database file. Accepted formats: `.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3` (max 100MB).

A confirmation dialog appears before the import proceeds. On success, the current database is replaced and the bookings table refreshes automatically.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Warning</strong>
  <p>Importing a database replaces all existing bookings. Export a backup first if you want to preserve the current data.</p>
</div>

## Bookings Table

The main table lists all bookings with sortable columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique booking identifier (deterministic for Kueue bookings, random for user bookings) |
| **User** | The booking owner (OpenShift username or namespace name for Kueue bookings) |
| **Resource** | GPU resource type (e.g. `nvidia.com/gpu`, `nvidia.com/mig-1g.18gb`) |
| **Unit** | Slot index (1-based) |
| **Date** | Booking date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| **Slot** | Always "Full Day" |
| **Source** | `reserved` (user) or `consumed` (Kueue) |
| **Hours (UTC)** | Full Day or specific hour range |
| **Description** | User-provided description or dash |
| **Created** | Timestamp when the booking was created |
| **Actions** | Delete button with confirmation |

Click any sortable column header to sort ascending; click again to reverse.

## Deleting Bookings

### Single Booking

Click the **Delete** button on any row. A confirmation prompt appears with **Confirm** and **Cancel** buttons. Admin can delete any booking, including consumed Kueue bookings.

### Delete All

Click **Delete All** in the table header. A confirmation prompt shows the total count. After deletion, consumed bookings will be repopulated on the next Kueue sync cycle.

---

## Reservation Sync Toggle

The **Reservations ON/OFF** button in the header controls whether the server syncs Kueue LocalQueue usage and manages per-user ClusterQueues at runtime.

- **ON** (green) -- the server polls LocalQueues, creates consumed bookings, and manages reservation ClusterQueues
- **OFF** (red) -- sync and reservation management are paused; existing bookings and ClusterQueues are not affected

This is useful for maintenance windows or debugging without needing to redeploy.

---

## Auto-Refresh

The admin dashboard automatically refreshes every 30 seconds to show the latest bookings and sync state. You can also click **Refresh** at any time.
